user places a pixel: send the command to the server
get feedback and place the pixel accordingly (depending on if the user is in cooldown)

when an user places a pixel, the server gets their ip and sets their cooldown (file of people in cooldown, updated when someone places a pixel, to delete useless lines)
the server then updates the grid chunk

every 10s? every user asks the server for changes (list of changes stored in log files, client has a "version" to know which changes to apply)
every log file (1000 changes), a snapshot is created to avoid querying too much information: new clients and very much outdated clients get changes starting from this state
each client has another server-side cooldown to limit this query

display currently active users (server map update request in the last interval*2)

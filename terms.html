            <h3>Contributing</h3>

            <p>You are free to express yourself through powe-r/place, as is suggested by its anarchic nature. However, You are responsible for what You choose to create. Illegal builds, or builds considered harmful in any way are prohibited.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Server storage</h3>
            <p>Data from power-r/place users is also stored server-side, on glitch.com. This data is privately kept for powe-r/place use only, unless explicitely stated. This data includes, but is not limited to the following:</p>
            <p>Firstly, We may store logs of every change that happened to the canvas. This information is used to improve Your user experience by sending less data through the internet when updating Your local copy of the canvas, but can also be used in other ways, for example to render timelapses.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may store statistics such as but not limited to the number of pixels You placed, or the time You placed Your last pixel. This data is needed by powe-r/place to render the timeout and powerup systems possible. You may contact us to request the removal of this data, but You will see Your progress erased.</p>
            <p>Finally, we store Your IP address to allow us to recognize Your connection and send You data about Your progress, such as the data previously covered. You may contact us to request the removal of this data, but You will see Your progress erased.</p>
